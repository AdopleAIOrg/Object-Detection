# Object-Detection
This project is a simple example of how to use the DETR model for object detection in Python.

# Installation
To install the dependencies, run the following command:

     pip install -r requirements.txt
     
# Usage

To run the object detection demo, run the following command:

    !streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501

This will open a Streamlit app in your browser. You can then upload an image to the app and it will be processed by the DETR model. The detected objects will be displayed on the image, along with their confidence scores
